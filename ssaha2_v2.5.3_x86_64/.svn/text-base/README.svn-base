DESCRIPTION:

ssaha2Build  This program constructs the hashtable
             required by the other ssaha2 programs.
             This provides an index for the given subject
             sequence.

ssaha2       This program aligns query sequences against a
             subject hashtable.

ssahaSNP     ssahaSNP is a polymorphism detection tool.
             It detects homozygous SNPs and indels by aligning
             shotgun reads to the finished genome sequence.
             From the best alignment, SNP candidates are
             screened, taking into account the quality value
             of the bases with variation as well as the quality
             values in the neighbouring bases, using 
             neighbourhood quality standard (NQS).

      ssaha2Build [OPTIONS] -save <hash name> <subject file>

      ssaha2 [OPTIONS] -save <hash name> <query file> [<query file 2nd>]
      ssaha2 [OPTIONS] <subject file> <query file> [<query file 2nd>]

      ssahaSNP [OPTIONS] -save <hash name> <query file>
      ssahaSNP [OPTIONS] <subject file> <query file>

   where <subject file> and <query file> are fasta or fastq files with
   the reference (subject) and query sequence files. <hash name> is
   the root name of the hash table files created from the reference
   sequence using ssaha2Build.
   The paired-end module invoked with the -pair option (see below)
   expects two query files with file <query file> containing the first
   and <query file 2nd> containing the second mate of each pair. The
   mates of a paired-end read must occur at the same postion in the
   sequence of reads in <query file> and <query file 2nd>. The paired-
   end module is not available for ssahaSNP.

OPTIONS:

 -h, -help     Print this page.
 -v, -version  Print version information.
 -c, -cookbook Print some example parameter sets, suitable
               for common tasks.

All other options, except the '-solexa' and '-454' flags and the
'-output ssaha2 cigar' option, are key-value pairs. Options are described below
(default values in brackets):

 -save <FILENAME>
            ssaha2Build: Root name of the files to which the
                         hash table is saved. The set of files
                         have the extensions FILENAME.head FILENAME.body
                         FILENAME.name FILENAME.base FILENAME.size
            ssaha2, ssahaSNP: Read hash table from files created by ssaha2Build.
	                   If -save is not specified then the first file name
                         specifies the reference sequence for which a hash

 -quality:  Quality value to use for variation base in NQS (23).

 -tags:     If set to 1, prefix added to output summary lines to
            aid parsing, the prefix depends upon the chosen
            output format, e.g. if output is ssaha2 then the
            prefix is ALIGNMENT (1).

 -output:   ssaha2       - original ssaha2 line only (default)
            sugar        - Simple UnGapped Alignment Report

            sam          - SAM format (http://samtools.sourceforge.net). Output
                           is written to a file specified with the -oufile flag.

            sam_soft     - SAM format using soft clipping. The entire read is
                           output./n/n            for a full description of output formats see:
                 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/SSAHA2/formats.shtml

 -name      Flag that modifies option '-output cigar' such that read name
            and length are also reported when there was no hit found.

 -diff:     Output all hits within diff of the best (-1).

 -udiff:    Ignore best hit if second best score within udiff (0).

 -fix:      If set to 1, fix -edge, -seeds, -score so that they
            are not updated according to read length in ssahaSNP (0).

 -disk:     0: map all files into memory including the query sequences. (0)
            1: read hashtable body, the subject and query sequences from disk
               rather than loading them into memory.
            2: like 1 but the subject sequences are read into memory. The body
               is left on the disk.
            In both cases the query sequence file is not mapped into memory.
 -weight:   If >0, apply this much weighting to rare kmers (0).

 -solexa:   (see -rtype) implies (ssaha2 and ssahaSNP only):
            -kmer 13 -skip 2 -seeds 2 -score 12 -cmatch 9 -ckmer 6.
            Top scoring hits with lower quality at the mismatch positions
            have their Smith-Waterman score incremented by 1. Mapping
            scores are changed accordingly. SsahaSNP reports in such cases
            only the top scoring hit (no Repeat lines).

 -rtype:    solexa          - like -solexa flag
            454             - like -454 flag
            abi             - tunes for ABI reads (default)

 -pair <dist_lower>,<dist_upper>: Map paired-end reads with an insert length in
            the interval [<dist_lower>,<dist_upper>]. The reads for each mate
            are in a separate input file named by the last two tokens of the
            command line. The sequence for both mates are read in the same
            direction. Paired-end reads are reported if the mates match within
            <dist_upper> bases from each other, but at least <dist_lower> bases
            apart. No mate is reported, if the mapping is ambiguous, i.e. if
            there are multipe hits with the same Smith-Waterman alignment score
            in the specified distance range.
            If hits are found only for one mate, the highest scoring hit is
            reported for this mate unless it is ambiguous.

 -outfile <file_name> Output file for output in SAM format or, if the -pair
            option is set, for mate pairs that map outside the specified
            distance range unambiguously (each with a mapping score > 30, or a
            value set with the -mthresh option below).

 -mthresh <mapping_score>  Threshold in the mapping score for mate pairs to be
            reported that map outside the distance range (see option -outfile).
            <mapping_score> is an integer between 0 and 50 (default: 30).
            This option requires the -pair option to be set.

 -multi <rand_seed> Flag modifying the way paired-end reads with multiple
            (repetitive) mappings are reported. If rand_seed == 0: skip such
            pairs entirely. if rand_seed> 0: select one pair at random.
            <rand_seed> seeds the random number generator.


==========
Change Log from version 2.0 onwards
==========

Release 2.5.3 (01 September 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Modified the -best option wich now now takes negative values '-best -<b>' in which
  case the alignment is reported only if there are at most <b> best mappings.

(2.5.3: 01 September 2010, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.5.2 (26 May 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bugs where program execution stopped early on some FASTQ files when the -disk 1
  option was used. 

(2.5.2: 26 May 2010, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.5.1 (8 February 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Bug fix concerning mapping score of paired-end reads in most output 
  formats (with the exception of the SAM output format):
 
  The Mapping score of one of the mates of a pair (the one with fewer
  k-mer word hits across the genome) could be too high. Both mates of
  a pair are now assigned the same mapping score analogous to the SAM
  output format.

Release 2.5 (6 October 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features:

- New output option '-output sam_soft' produced SAM output with 'soft
  clipping', i.e. the sequence of the entire read is ouptut.  '-output
  sam' only outputs the aligned segment of the read (hard
  clipping).

- Changed -kmer and -skip default paramters for -rtype abi to -kmer 13
  -skip 13 -solexa, -454 and -rtype <read_type> options can now be
  specified with ssaha2Build as well as ssaha2. I.e. -kmer and -skip no
  longer have to be explicitly specified with ssaha2Build.

  This means one can build a hash table with
  > ssaha2Build -454 -save <htab_name> <fasta_file>
  then run the mapping with something like
  > ssaha2 -454 -output cigar -save <htab_name> <fastq_file>

- added option -multi <rand_seed> for the random selection of a read-pair
  in cases were there are multiple mappings with the same score.

- The mates of paired-end reads can now differ in length. In previous versions they
  had to be of identical length.

- Output in SAM format now included unmapped reads. Hitherto their output
  had been suppressed.

- SAM output: 'proper' pairs are now assigned the average score rather than the
  sum of scores of the mates.


Bug fixes:

- Fixed a core dump with option -output SAM when query reads were
  given in FASTA files without quality values.</li>

- Fixed SAM output to extra file '-output sam -outfile
  <file_name>' for single-end reads (i.e. -pair option not
  specified). Previous versions ignored the -outfile option if the
  -pair option was not specified. As a consequence mappings of
  single-end reads were writtend to standard output even for the SAM
  format.


- Fixed PSLX and PSL output format. Apparently, those never worked
  properly in any version.

- Fixed -disk 1 and -disk 2 flags which were broken for paired-end reads.

- Fixed a bug in the alignment display (option -align 1) of paired-end reads.
  The mapping coordinates of the 2nd mate were wrong in the display.

(2.5: 6 October 2009, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.4.1 (25 August 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- fixed a few things concerning the SAM output format:
  
  i) Bits 0x40 (read is first in pair) and 0x80 (read is 2nd in pair)
  of the binary FLAG field were set inconsistently due to an
  initialisation issue.

  ii) The read name in the QNAME files is now stripped of any '/1' and '/2'
  tags.

- This version still requires paired-end reads to be of the same length.
  Where this is not the case an error message is output. Mates of differing
  lengths can be processed using ssaha_pileup.

(2.4.1: 25 August 2009, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.4 (21 Juli 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- added output in SAM format (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) with
  the option '-output sam'. 

  SAM output is written either all to standard output or to a file
  specified with -output <filename>.

  The MAPQ-field of the SAM-format specification contains a new
  mapping score. The old SSAHA2 mapping score is output in an optional
  field with tag 'MS' (not defined by SAM-format spec).

- fixed a bug that resulted in core dumps when the query read files
  for paired-end read did not contain quality values, i.e. when the
  read files where in FASTA rather than FASTQ format. A default
  quality value of 40 is assigned in such cases.

- ssaha2 -kmer and -skip options are no longer overwritten by the
  parameters of the hash table when the -save <hash table> option is
  used. Now ssaha2 exits with an error message if the kmer word lenght
  and skip step size specified on the command line with the -kmer and
  -skip options do not agree with the parameters used for the
  generation of the hash table.

(2.4: 21 Juli 2009, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.3.0.1  (3 April 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- fixed a bug in version 2.3 that occurred for paired-end
  reads. Quality values following a quality value of 0 in the read
  were undefined.

(2.3.1.0.1: 3 April 2009, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.3  (6 March 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added '-mthresh <MSCORE>' option by which a threshold in the mapping
  score can be set above which mate pairs are reported that map outside
  the insert size range. 0<= MSCORE <= 50. The default is -mthresh 30.

- fixed a bug introduced in 2.2 that caused the assignment
  of wrong mapping scores for mate pairs.

(2.3: 6 March 2009, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.2.1 (16 February 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- fixed bug introduced in version 2.2 where reads with > 5000 bases
  matched over the entire length in which case execution stopped with
  the message "position_table - Query probably contains unusual
  characters".

(2.2.1: 16 February 2009, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.2 (29 January 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- added '-disk 2' option where hash table body and the query sequences
  are left on disk and the hashtable header and the reference
  sequences are kept in memory.

- The '-disk 0' option now keeps the reference sequences in memory.

- The paired-end read module (invoked with '-pair a,b') now
  requires separate input files for the reads of the two mates.
  The direction of the sequences are the same for both mates. 

- added Tony Cox' output format '-output aln'.

- minor fixes that improved the accuracy of ssaha2.

- Fix of a bug (introduced in version 2.0.0) that had ssaha2 stopping
  execution with the message "position_table - Query probably contains
  unusual characters" on some longer (>5000 bases) query reads.

(2.2: 29 January 2009, ssaha2 hp3)


Release 2.1 (18 September 2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- implemented paired-end read module with option '-pair a,b' specifying an
  insert range and '-outfil' specifying an output file for pairs mapping
  outside this range.

- '-solexa' and '-rtype solexa' flags now imply
  '-kmer 13 -skip 2 -seeds 2 -score 12 -cmatch 9 -ckmer 6'
  These defaults can be overwritten, i.e. '-rtype solexa -kmer 12'.

- reduced memory usage for query files with a large
  number of short reads.

- Occasionally the first few bases are missed in the Smith-Waterman alignment if
  these bases contain mismatches. This version restores the full alignment if the
  -solexa (-rtype solexa) flag is set and the Smith-Waterman alignment starts (ends)
  at the 3rd or 4th (to last) base.

- Fixed a bug in the PSL and PSLX output formats (wrong block starts).

(2.1: 18 September 2008, ssaha2 hp3)

Release 2.0.0 (16 May 2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- improved speed for shorter reads (-solexa and -454 flags):

  Changes were made to the filtering of potentially matching segments
  before they are passed to the Smith-Waterman alignment. Potetial
  matches are filtered out if the number of matching k-mer words
  (seeds) falls below MAXSEEDS - 5 where MAXSEEDS is the maximum in
  the number of seeds observed so far for the query sequence.

  ABI reads (default) are processed as before.

- -edge option is now obsolete. Matching segments are now extended to the
  query read length plus 10 bases on either side.

- -solexa flag now implies -cmatch 9 (previously -cmatch 10), i.e. overall
  '-seeds 2 -score 12 -cmatch 9 -ckmer 6'.

(2.0.0: 16 May 2008, ssaha2 hp3)
